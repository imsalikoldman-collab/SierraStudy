# External Dependencies

This directory is intentionally empty and excluded from source control. Use it to store local-only artifacts such as:
- Sierra Chart SDK archives.
- Custom tools required for development.

Ensure the `SIERRA_SDK_DIR` environment variable points to the ACSIL headers contained in your Sierra Chart installation, typically:

```
C:\SierraChart\ACS_Source
```

Do not commit proprietary SDK files to the repository.
